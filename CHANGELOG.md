- Client would disconnect from pipe when trying to update presence incrementally

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/jewlexx/discord-presence/releases/tag/v1.5.0)

  - This should result in slight performance improvements
    from not allocating more than necessary.

  - This downgrades the windows crate to a version that is compatible with the MSRV
- `Manager::new` function is now `pub(crate)`. This makes no difference to the public API, as the `Manager` struct was never public.

### Breaking Changes

- Send & Receive Loop now breaks for `ConnectionRefused` error kind, rather than `WouldBlock`

- Removed `STARTED` boolean. (Pretty much pointless as it is only different between when the client has been started, but is not yet ready)
- Increase connection timeout on Windows to 16 seconds
- `on_event` now returns an EventCallbackHandle, which, if dropped, removes the event handler

### Added

- Support buttons [#38](https://github.com/jewlexx/discord-presence/issues/38)
